# Assembly Exercises

Assembly homework from 2nd year of university with the purpose of having a better understanding of assembly language, which was achieved by 4 exercises with gradually increasing difficulties.

# Exercises

1. Reverse One Time Pad (Easy): Implementation of One Time Pad in assembly, but with a reversed key. A XOR is applied between the message and reversed key, with the final result being stored in "ciphertext".

2. Ages (Medium): Calculates the age of multiple people received in a file, and stored in a structure, by extracting the birth date from the current date.

3. Columnar Transposition Cipher (Hard): Assembly implementation of Columnar Transposition, in which matrix operations are involved.

4. Cache Load Simulation (Very Hard): Simulation of loading data from memory in registers, by also accounting Cache existence.
